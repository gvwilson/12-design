Thank you for your mail - I have made the following changes as requested:

1.  Bibliography is now included in the .tex file.

2.  Corresponding author now indicated with '*'.

3.  City, province, and country added to institutional affiliation.

4.  All citations are numeric in square brackets.

5.  All boxes are now numbered and referenced from the main text.
    (One box has been inlined.)

6.  Embedded diagrams have been removed by commenting out
    \includegraphics commands.

7.  Figure references are now "Fig 3" rather than "Figure 3".

8.  Figure files are named accordingly.

9.  Acknowledgments have (reluctantly) been removed.
